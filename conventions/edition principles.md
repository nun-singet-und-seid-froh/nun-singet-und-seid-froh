# edition principles
While *conventions for entering a piece* are describing rules for the *input* of the notes, these *edition principles* describe rules for the *output* of the notes.

# page settings
1. The output shall be optimized to be printed as an A3-brochure. That means, if possible without bigger concessions to layout and readabiliy, the output including the title page shall have (best case) 4n-1 or (second best) 4n pages.
2. The staff-size shall not be smaller than 16

# accidentals and naturals
1. Accidentals ocurring in an antecendent bar are naturalized, even if they occur in a different staff. (Naturals are dealt with analogously.)
