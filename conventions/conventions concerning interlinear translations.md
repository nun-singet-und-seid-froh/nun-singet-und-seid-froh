Interlinear translations shall be provided to the project by writing an .ilf-file. The syntactic rules the ilf-file must meet are defined in [the ilf standard](https://github.com/nun-singet-und-seid-froh/nun-singet-und-seid-froh/blob/master/conventions/the%20ilf-standard.md). The conventions in hand are using the terminology ("boxes", "rows") as defined in this document.

Beyond these syntactic rules we have some conventions for designing the translations. These conventions shall guarantee a standardised structure (and look) of all translations in the whole nun-singet-und-seid-froh-edition. These conventions are:

1. The interlinear translation shall be a word-for-word-translation.
2. The linebreaking in the original text shall be represented in the ilf. 
3. The first row has to be the original text. It shall be formatted *large*.
4. The second row shall be the phonetical transcription of the lyrics using the tipa-package of LaTex. It shall be formatted *small*.
5. The third row shall describe the grammar of the original text. It shall be formatted *tiny*, *caps* and *sans*.
6. The following row(s) shall represent the translation(s). These rows shall be formatted *sans* and - if there are multiple languages the text is translated to - alternating *italic*.
