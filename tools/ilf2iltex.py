********************************************************************************
*************               CONCEPT OF THE SCRIPT                  *************
********************************************************************************

This python-script takes a representation of an interlinear translation given 
as *.ilf (interlinear file) and outputs a LaTex code that will typeset the 
interlinear translation.

The problem with typesetting interlinear translations is the fact that different 
lines (which represent different languages) do not have the same amount of 
words. For example a declined word in latin can only be translated into english 
by using a preposition, e.g. "filius dei" may be translated as "son of god". 
In this example you would want the words to be aligned something like this:

filius   dei
 son   of god

This script uses a concept of "boxes" to achieve this behaviour: A box can 
contain multiple words, and the boxes of the different languages are aligned 
to each other, so that the first box of each language will be aligned with the
first box of the original language, the second box of each language will be
aligned with the second box of the original language, and so on.


********************************************************************************
*************              DEFINITION OF ilf-INPUT                 *************
********************************************************************************

This said, we only have to define how the input file must be formatted to be 
processed correctly by this script:

1. It has n *rows* and consists of k*(n+1) *lines*. n is the number of 
languages and can be arbitrarily chosen.
2. If l is the line number [be careful to not mix up line and row in this 
sentence ;-)] of the input file, every line l with l= x*(n+1)+1 
contains the original language, every line l with l = x*(n+1)+2 contains the 
first translation language, and so on up to every line l with 
l = (x+1)*(n+1), which has to be an empty line (be aware that this implies 
that the last line of the *.ilf must be empty.) We will call a number of lines 
from l ..l+(n+1) a "block" - a block represents a part of the original text with
all its translations, and the *.ilf consists of k blocks.
4. The first block will not be typeset and contains header-information for 
formatting each row in the LaTex-output
5. A box-break in a row is defined by either a TAB or by starting a new block. 
The fact that TAB can be used as box-delimiter makes input easily readable when 
using a text-editor that works with so-called *elastic tabs*
6. If the original text has linebreaks, every linebreak is marked by a 
 "#"-sign in the first row.

********************************************************************************
*************            SOME ADDITIONAL FEATURES                  *************
********************************************************************************

The script converts all ocurrences of *TEXT* into \emph{TEXT} and all ocurrences
of "TEXT" into \enquote{text}

********************************************************************************
*************              LaTex-PACKAGES NEEDED                   *************
********************************************************************************

For processing the LaTex file, the following packages must be loaded:
  [utf8]{inputenc}
  {stackengine}
  {csquotes}
