If you are **interested in contributing** and wonder how to start, read the [installation requirements](https://github.com/nun-singet-und-seid-froh/nun-singet-und-seid-froh/wiki/installation-requirements) and [how to add a new piece](https://github.com/nun-singet-und-seid-froh/nun-singet-und-seid-froh/wiki/how-to-add-a-new-piece) in the git's wiki. (More detailed information that will make it easier for you to contribute will be added to the wiki soon.)

If you just want to get the lilypond-files of one particular piece for your personal use, it's best for you to read [how to download a single piece](https://github.com/nun-singet-und-seid-froh/nun-singet-und-seid-froh/wiki/how-to-download-source-code-of-a-single-piece)
